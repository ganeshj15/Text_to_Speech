# Text_to_Speech
Text  will be converted to audio format

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology.This can be used for those who are having some issues to read.
In this project I have used gtts(Google Text to Speech) Library of Python for converting text to speech.For playing and saving the converted sound, I used playsound library and lastly for GUI one of the popular TKinter is used.
So these librarires have to be installed and I used playsound 1.2.2 since latest version is giving some compatibility issues.
